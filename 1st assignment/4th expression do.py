"""



In Python, an expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value. It can be as simple as a single value or variable, or it can involve complex computations.

Expressions can perform a variety of operations, such as mathematical calculations, logical evaluations, or string manipulations. They can also be used to assign values to variables, make comparisons, or control the flow of program execution.

All expressions in Python have a specific type and evaluate to a resulting value. The resulting value can be of any data type, such as numbers (integers, floating-point numbers), strings, booleans, or even more complex objects like lists or dictionaries.

Here are a few examples of expressions in Python:

    

Mathematical expression:    
result = 2 + 3 * 5  # Evaluates to 17



String concatenation expression:    
greeting = "Hello, " + "world!"  # Evaluates to "Hello, world!"



Comparison expression:
is_equal = (5 == 5)  # Evaluates to True



Function call expression:
length = len("Hello")  # Evaluates to 5



Expressions are fundamental building blocks in Python programming and are used extensively to perform computations and manipulate data.
