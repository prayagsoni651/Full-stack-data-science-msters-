difference between expression and a statement 



Expression   


         > AN expression is a combination of values 
          variable,operator and function call thta 
          when eveuleted result in a value 
         > Expression can be used for perform calculation
           ,retrive values, or creat a new values.
         > Example of expression 3*4,3+4,123-42,23//4
         
         
         
statement 


        > A statement is a complete instruction 
         or action that perfrom a specific task.
        > statement are used to control the flow of 
          execution define behaviour or a modify
          program state.
        > statement can include expression, but 
          they can also include other staement or 
          keywords.
          
          
          
          
          
          
The key distinction is that expression produes values
while statement perform action or control the flow 
of the program in the case of an assignment statement like 
'spam = 10' , it assign the value 10 to the variable 
'spam' Although it contain an expression ('10'),the 
entire line is considered a statement because it 
perform as action(assigning a value)rather than producing
a value
